# Continual-Fewshot-Domain-Adaptation
Continual Few-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CFUDA) is a continual learning end-to-end framework inspired by the [CVPR](http://xyue.io/pcs-fuda/) paper in 2021. 

### Overview
This study focuses primarily on analyzing the performance of two different Task-Incremental learning intuitive strategies named *Baseline* and
*Naive* algorithms as a continual learner. Besides,the model faces a stream of tasks over time an unsupervised domain adaptation technique is performed over each task while the source domain contains only a few labeled sample.
